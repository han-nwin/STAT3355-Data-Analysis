# The 7 Steps of Hypothesis Testing

1. **State the null and alternative hypotheses:** Formulate H₀ and Hₐ.

2. **Choose the significance level:** Decide on α, typically 0.05.

3. **Determine the appropriate test statistic:** Based on the sample data and hypothesis.

4. **Formulate the decision rule:** Based on the critical value or p-value approach.

5. **Collect data and calculate the test statistic:** Obtain the sample and compute the statistic.

6. **Make a decision:** Compare the test statistic to the critical value or p-value to decide.

7. **Draw a conclusion:** State whether you reject or fail to reject H₀.
