4 Question 2: Gender Differences in Home Advantage
4.1 Overview
We examine whether male and female gymnasts benefit differently from hosting.
Medal Rates by Gender:
Male Gymnasts: - Host: 17.17 % - Non-host: 7.95 % - Difference: 9.22 pp
Female Gymnasts: - Host: 13.3 % - Non-host: 8.16 % - Difference: 5.14 pp8.2%

T-Test Results:
Males: - T-statistic: -9.529 - P-value: <2e-16 - Result: Significant
Females: - T-statistic: -3.785 - P-value: 0.000167 - Result: Significant
4.3 Temporal Trends: Has the Gender Gap Changed Over Time?
We examine whether the home advantage effect for males vs females has changed across different Olympic
eras.
Home Advantage by Gender Across Eras:
Early (1896-1948) - Female: 34.07 pp - Male: 1.18 pp
Mid (1952-1988) - Female: 3.86 pp - Male: 11.3 pp
Modern (1992-2020) - Female: 2.76 pp - Male: 8.88 pp

4.4 Question 2 Summary
Key Findings:
1. Overall home advantage by gender:
 Male home advantage: 9.22 percentage points
 Female home advantage: 5.14 percentage points
 Males show a larger overall home advantage effect
2. Temporal trends - Era-by-era analysis:
Early (1896-1948):
 Male advantage: 1.18 pp
 Female advantage: 34.07 pp
 Females show 32.89 pp larger advantage in this era
Mid (1952-1988):
 Male advantage: 11.3 pp
 Female advantage: 3.86 pp
 Males show 7.44 pp larger advantage in this era
Modern (1992-2020):
 Male advantage: 8.88 pp
 Female advantage: 2.76 pp
 Males show 6.13 pp larger advantage in this era
3. Interpretation: Home advantage effects vary significantly across time periods, with different patterns
emerging in early vs modern Olympics.

Average Gymnast Count per Country:
 Host countries: 23.5 gymnasts
 Non-host countries: 7.2 gymnasts
 Difference: 16.3 gymnasts
T-Test: Host vs Non-Host Participation
 T-statistic: -3.328
