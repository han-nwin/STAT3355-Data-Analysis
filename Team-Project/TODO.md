## 📋 TODO - Statistical Analysis (After Data Prep Complete)

### Question 1 Analysis
- [ ] Descriptive statistics: Medal rates for host vs non-host
- [ ] Chi-square test: Is_host vs medal_won
- [ ] Logistic regression: medal_won ~ is_host + controls
- [ ] T-test: Compare hosting year medals to historical baseline
- [ ] Create visualizations (bar charts, effect plots)

### Question 2 Analysis
- [ ] Stratified analysis by gender (M vs F)
- [ ] Interaction model: medal_won ~ is_host × Sex
- [ ] Compare effect sizes between genders
- [ ] Visualizations showing gender differences

### Question 3 Analysis
- [ ] Compare home advantage by country size (Small/Medium/Large)
- [ ] First-time vs repeat host analysis
- [ ] Participation rates (gymnast_count) analysis
- [ ] ANOVA or regression with categorical predictors

### Question 4 Analysis
- [ ] Correlation: GDP per capita vs home advantage magnitude
- [ ] Regression: home_advantage ~ gdp_per_capita + demographics
- [ ] Rich vs poor host comparison
- [ ] Demographic structure effects (working age proportion, etc.)
