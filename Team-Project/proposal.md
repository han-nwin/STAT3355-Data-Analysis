## **Background**

This project investigates whether hosting the Olympics provides a measurable home advantage in **gymnastics**, a sport heavily influenced by subjective judging. Since performances are evaluated by panels rather than objective metrics like time or distance, subtle judging biases-intentional or not-may favor athletes from the host nation.

By analyzing Olympic gymnastics data spanning more than a century, we aim to determine whether **hosting correlates with increased medal counts or higher scores** for the host nation's gymnasts. We also examine whether this advantage varies based on factors such as **first-time hosting, country size, wealth, or demographic structure**.

## **Motivation**

Gymnastics is one of the most prestigious Olympic sports but is unique because outcomes depend on **human judgment**, not purely objective performance. This makes gymnastics an ideal case for studying bias in subjective evaluation.

The Olympics provide a natural experiment every four years: some countries host, others don't, and we have measurable outcomes across many sports. Using a long historical dataset, we can analyze whether hosting correlates with statistically significant performance boosts-and whether certain national characteristics amplify that effect.

Understanding this relationship matters for:

* **Statistical modeling**
* **Fairness in international competition**
* **Judging transparency**

If consistent bias exists, it raises questions about the integrity of judging systems and fairness in international scoring.

## **Big Question**

### **Does hosting the Olympics provide a measurable competitive advantage in gymnastics, and what national factors influence the strength of that advantage?**

---

## **Specific Questions**

### **1. Does hosting the Olympics provide a measurable competitive advantage in gymnastics?**

* Do host nations win significantly more gymnastics medals during their hosting year compared to historical baselines?
* What is the average percentage increase in total medals and gold medals for host countries?

### **2. Does the home advantage in gymnastics differ by gender?**

* Do female gymnasts benefit more from hosting than male gymnasts?
* Has the gender gap in home advantage changed over time?

### **3. Does hosting experience and country size influence the magnitude of home advantage?**

* Do first-time host nations gain a bigger boost than repeat hosts?
* Do smaller countries (by area or population) experience larger percentage increases in medal counts?
* Does the host nation field more participating gymnasts, potentially influencing outcomes?

### **4. How do economic and demographic factors affect home advantage?**

* Among host countries, do those with higher GDP per capita see different magnitude in medal increases?
* Do countries with younger median ages or larger working-age populations gain more advantage when hosting?

---

## **Why These Questions Matter**

These questions explore both **whether** home advantage in gymnastics exists and **why** it varies across countries.

* The first question tests for an overall hosting effect.
* The second examines gender differences.
* The third investigates structural factors such as country size and hosting experience.
* The fourth connects economics and demographics to competitive performance.

Together, they paint a complete picture of which nations benefit most from hosting - and under what conditions - offering insights into fairness, judging bias, and international sports dynamics.
