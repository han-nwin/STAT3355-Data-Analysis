STAT 3355 Introduction to Data Analysis

# Question 1

A cola beverage company claims that their cans are filled with 16.00 ounces of cola. Mark doesn’t want to
pay for 16 ounces of soda unless he is getting at least that much soda. Thus, he samples 10 cola cans from
this beverage company to test their claim. The data from his experiment is given below:

| Can Number | Fill (ounces) |
|------------|---------------|
| 1 | 15.997 |
| 2 | 16.005 |
| 3 | 15.981 |
| 4 | 15.954 |
| 5 | 15.986 |
| 6 | 16.021 |
| 7 | 15.985 |
| 8 | 16.001 |
| 9 | 16.018 |
| 10 | 16.056 |

• Perform a one-sided significance test of the null hypothesis that the fill of the cola cans is 16.00 ounces
against the alternative that the fill of the cola cans is less than 16.00 ounces, following the procedure
of seven steps in the lecture notes (choose a significance level of 0.05).

# Question 2

Mary claims that the number of minutes for app engagement by a tablet user is 8.2 minutes. John thinks
that 8.2 minutes is too little time and wants to prove Mary wrong. He takes a sample of 60 tablet users, and
finds that x̄ = 8.412 and s = 1.512 minutes.

• Perform a one-sided significance test of the null hypothesis that the number of minutes for app en-
gagement by a tablet user is 8.2 minutes against the alternative that the number of minutes for app
engagement by a tablet user is more than 8.2 minutes, following the procedure of seven steps in the
lecture notes (choose a significance level of 0.05).

# Question 3

A study involving stress is done on college campuses across the USA. The study claims that 70% of college
students in the USA are stressed. A survey of 200 students at a particular United States college campus finds
that 130 students are stressed. Does this new data suggest that the stress percentage of college students in
the USA is different from 70%?

• Perform a two-sided significance test for a proportion, following the procedure of seven steps in the
lecture note (choose a significance level of 0.05).

• Use the related function in R to report the p-value. What’s your conclusion based on the result?

# Question 4

Suppose that a market research analyst for a cell phone company conducts a study of their customers’ cell
phone data usage. The analyst takes a sample of 500 customers of which 70% are between the ages of 18−50
years (included), and the rest are above the age of 50 years. The average cell phone data usage among the
sampled 18−50 years old customers is 2 Gb, and the average cell phone data usage among the other category
is 1.85 Gb. The sample standard deviations for each customer categories are 0.812 and 0.837, respectively.
Does the data support that people older than the age of 50 years use less cell phone data than people that
are between the ages of 18− 50 years (included)?

• Perform a one-sided significance test for mean cell phone data usage difference between the two age
categories, following the procedure of seven steps in the lecture note (choose a significance level of
0.05).

# Question 5

A surveyor asked 70 students from STAT 3355 about whether or not they played video games. The surveyor
asked 30 male students, and 40 female students. The results revealed that 22 male students played video
games while 24 female students played video games. Is there statistical evidence that among the students
that are enrolled in STAT 3355 more males play video games?

• Perform a one-sided significance test for proportion difference, following the procedure of seven steps
in the lecture note (choose a significance level of 0.05).

# Problem 6

In the United States in 2007, the proportion of adults age 21-24 who had no medical insurance was 28.1%.
A survey of 75 recent college graduates in this age range finds that 30 of them are without insurance. Does
this support a difference from the nationwide?

• Perform a two-sided significance test for a proportion, following the procedure of seven steps in the
lecture note (choose a significance level of 0.05).

• Use the related function in R to report the p-value. What’s your conclusion based on the result?

# Problem 7

In the past 30 days, a cell-phone store has sold 150 Apple iPhone and had 14 returned. It has sold 125
Samsung Galaxy and had 15 returned. Is there statistical evidence that Apple has a smaller chance of being
returned than Samsung?

• Perform a one-sided significance test for proportion difference, following the procedure of seven steps
in the lecture note (choose a significance level of 0.05).

• Use the related function in R to report the p-value. What’s your conclusion based on the result?

# Problem 8

For the babies dataset in the package UsingR, the variable age contains the mother’s age and the variable
dage contains the father’s age.

• Perform a two-sided significance test of the null hypothesis of equal ages against the alternative that
the ages are different in the sampled population, following the procedure of seven steps in the lecture
note (choose a significance level of 0.05).

• Use the related function in R to report the p-value. What’s your conclusion based on the result?
