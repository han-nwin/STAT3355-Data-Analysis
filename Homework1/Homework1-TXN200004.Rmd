```

# Problem 1

```{r, problem1}
# If I wrote code that would be used in all following letters, it would go here
```

## a)

```{r, problem_1a}
# This is where my code for this question goes
a <- 8 + 9 - 7 / 3^0.3
```

This is me placing the alleged answer to this question in text: a = ```r a```

## b)

```{r, problem_1b}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## c)

```{r, problem_1c}
# This is where my code for this question goes
mu_1 <- 5.564231
```

This is me using a mathematical symbol to state the alleged mean $\mu_1$ = ```r mu_1```

## d)

```{r, problem_1d}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## e)

```{r, problem_1e}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## f)

```{r, problem_1f}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

# Problem 2

```{r, problem2}
# If I wrote code that would be used in all following letters, it would go here
```

## a)

```{r, problem_2a}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## b)

```{r, problem_2b}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## c)

```{r, problem_2c}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## d)

```{r, problem_2d}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

# Problem 3

```{r, problem3}
# If I wrote code that would be used in all following letters, it would go here
```

## a)

```{r, problem_3a}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## b)

```{r, problem_3b}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## c)

```{r, problem_3c}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## d)

```{r, problem_3d}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

# Problem 4
```{r, problem4}
# If I wrote code that would be used in all following letters, it would go here
```

## a)

```{r, problem_4a}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## b)

```{r, problem_4b}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

## c)

```{r, problem_4c}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

# Problem 5

```{r, problem_5}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```

# Problem 6

```{r, problem_6}
# This is where my code for this question goes
```
