**Due:** November 4th (Tuesday)  
**Submit to:** eLearning (one copy from one group)

You must identify at least three variables under consideration to be cleaned. These could include:  
- The creation of a variable.  
- Standardizing information across data sets into one column.  
- Collapsing categories within a variable.

### PDF file includes:
- Short written summary of what was done to clean the variable(s).  
- Table(s) of variable prior to cleaning. This could be the variables used to create the variable, etc.  
- Table(s) of the final cleaned variable.

Dear Class,

I would like to add some clarification to your data cleaning assignment. You are **not required to turn in your code**, and can place everything you are turning in inside a Google Doc and export it to a PDF. Meaning, you can delegate coding assignments and simply pull the results without pulling the code.

For each item being cleaned you will turn in 3 things:

1. A plot or table summary of the variable you are cleaning prior to cleaning. You can also state the dimensions of two or more data sets you are merging.  
2. A short written explanation of what you are cleaning, why you are cleaning it, and what you expect to see at the end.  
3. The same plot or table summary but now using the cleaned variables. You can also state the dimensions of the final data set you have modified.

Please ask questions in class if you have any concerns.
