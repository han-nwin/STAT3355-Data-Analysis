43 Question 1: Does Hosting Provide Home Advantage?
3.1 Overview
We address two key questions:
1. Do host nations win significantly more gymnastics medals during their hosting year compared to
historical baselines?
2. What is the average percentage increase in total medals and gold medals for host countries?
3.2 Sub-question 1: Do Host Nations Win Significantly More Medals?
3.2.1 Descriptive Statistics
Medal Winning Rates:
• Host countries: 16.04 % ( 361 medals from 2250 performances)
• Non-host countries: 8.03 % ( 2112 medals from 26,304 performances)
• Difference: 8.02 percentage points

3.2.2 Statistical Test: Chi-Square Test and Two-Sample Proportions Test
We test whether the difference in medal rates is statistically significant. Since we’re comparing categorical
outcomes (medal won: yes/no) across two groups (host vs non-host), we can use either a chi-square test or
a two-proportion z-test (which are mathematically equivalent for 2×2 tables).

Hypotheses:
• H0: Host and non-host countries have the same medal-winning rate
• Ha: Host and non-host countries have different medal-winning rates
Contingency Table:
No Medal Medal Won
Non-Host 24192 2112
Host 1889 361
Chi-Square Test Results:
• Chi-square statistic: 167.316
• Degrees of freedom: 1
• P-value: <2e-16
Two-Proportion Z-Test Results:
• Test statistic (X-squared): 167.316
• P-value: <2e-16
• 95% Confidence Interval for difference: 6.44 % to 9.59 %
Note: Both tests are equivalent for 2×2 tables. The chi-square statistic equals the squared z-statistic.
Conclusion: The difference is statistically significant (p < 0.05). Host nations have a significantly higher
medal-winning rate.
3.3 Sub-question 2: Average Percentage Increase for Host Countries
We compare each host country’s performance during their hosting year to their historical baseline (average
in non-hosting years) to calculate the average percentage increase.
Performance Comparison:
• Average baseline rate (non-hosting years): 7.27 %
• Average hosting year rate: 20.47 %
• Average improvement: 13.2 percentage points
Paired T-Test Results:
• T-statistic: 2.892
• Degrees of freedom: 28
• P-value: 0.00732
• 95% CI for mean difference: 3.85 % to 22.55 %
Conclusion: Host countries perform significantly better during hosting years compared to their own his-
torical baseline (p < 0.05).

gender, chi-square tests are more appropriate than t-tests.

5 Question 3: Country Factors
5.1 Overview
We address three key questions about country characteristics:
1. Do first-time host nations gain a bigger boost than repeat hosts?
2. Do smaller countries (by area or population) experience larger percentage increases in medal counts?
3. Does the host nation field more participating gymnasts, potentially influencing outcomes?
5.2 Sub-question 1: Do Smaller Countries Experience Larger Increases?
Average Improvement by Country Size:
• Large : 12.06 pp (n = 9 )
• Medium : 3.66 pp (n = 4 )
• Small : 17.14 pp (n = 15 )

Chi-Square Test Results:
• Chi-square statistic: 1.934

• P-value: 0.38
• Result: Not significant - country size does not significantly affect improvement
Note: The p-value suggests no statistically significant relationship, but this may be due to small sample
sizes in some categories (n = 9, 4, 15 ).
5.3 Sub-question 2: Do First-Time Hosts Gain a Bigger Boost?
Average Improvement by Hosting Experience:
• First-Time hosts: 16.53 pp (n = 18 )
• Repeat hosts: 8.27 pp (n = 10 )
T-Test: First-Time vs Repeat Hosts
• T-statistic: 0.981
• P-value: 0.336
• Result: No significant difference
5.4 Sub-question 3: Do Host Nations Field More Gymnasts?
We examine whether host nations field larger gymnastics teams, which could potentially influence their
medal counts through increased opportunities.
Average Gymnast Count per Country:
• Host countries: 23.5 gymnasts
• Non-host countries: 7.2 gymnasts
• Difference: 16.3 gymnasts
T-Test: Host vs Non-Host Participation

6 Question 4: Economics & Demographics
6.1 Overview
We address two key questions about economic and demographic factors:
1. Among host countries, do those with higher GDP per capita see different magnitudes of medal in-
creases?
2. Do countries with larger working-age populations gain more advantage when hosting?
